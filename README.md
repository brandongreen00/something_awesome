# something_awesome - Brandon Green - COMP6441

Hello! Welcome to my git repo! These have all the files for my Something Awesome project.

## Things needed to run

### Given how my project is still in it's raw state, you'll need a few things to be able to run this on your own system.
* linux ubuntu terminal
* python3 (latest version)
** flask, flask_cors, json modules installed! (pip3 install <module here>) (if you don't have pip3, sudo apt install pip3 works with the linux ubuntu terminal!)

## How to run
Follow the below steps to run this on your computer, with the above things!
* Open linux terminal and go to the directory where these files have been downloaded
* Go into the something_awesome directory (this should be the folder you downloaded)
* Type the following into the terminal: python3 server.py
* NOTE: MY SERVER ONLY CAN RUN ON http://localhost:5000 . If this port is not avaliable, please free it!
* Go to http://localhost:5000 in your browser

And that should be it!
